The sample directory contains sample test data and a set of Pig Latin scripts to invoke analytic funtions on the data set.

To run scripts in local mode:
- cd to sample directory (the directory containing this README file)
- pig -x local <script>
- example: pig -x local rank.pig

Note: the scripts *WITHOUT* the "_mr" suffix in the names are designed to be run in pig local mode only, so remember to use "-x local" with pig to invoke the scripts.

To run scripts in mapreduce mode:
- Prerequisite: make sure a cluster is up and running
- cd to sample/scripts directory
- run "pig prepare_multifile_input.pig" to set up input data on HDFS.  You just need to run it once for all *_mr.pig scripts to work

Pig UDF in mapreduce mode:
- For the *_mr.pig scripts, just run them as "pig <script_name>"

Java Mapreduce:
- there are *_mr shell scripts (e.g. rank_mr.sh)  Just invoke it and watch the MR job results.
- For java MR jobs, the output is in output directory on HDFS.  Check the results by running 'hadoop fs -cat output/part-r-00000'
